# 20 Days of TypeScript 🚀

Welcome to **20 Days of TypeScript** – a personal journey to master TypeScript by building, breaking, and learning through hands-on practice for 20 days straight!

> 📅 Challenge Duration: 20 Days  
> 🧠 Goal: Learn by doing – one TypeScript topic, concept, or mini-project each day!

## 📌 Why This Repo?

TypeScript adds powerful static typing to JavaScript. This repo is a collection of my daily learnings, from basic types to advanced concepts, through small code examples, mini-projects, and notes.
